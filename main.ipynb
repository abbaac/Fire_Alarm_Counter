    "1. Data Collection & Preprocessing - The roboflow website contains numerous datasets. After merging a few properly annotated datasets, I produced a more diverse and complete dataset. Most of the preprocessing was done on the roboflow site to ensure annotations and photo resolutions were of proper quality and dimension.\n",
    "2. Data Ingestion - The dataset is sourced from Roboflow and is an Image Segmentation for detecting human beings.\n",
    "3. Hyper-parameter tuning - Setting the pretrained model from ultralytics as well as the other paramters such as number of epochs, image size etc to finetune the models performance.  \n",
    "4. Data Modelling & Training - Training a suitable model on the train set for periods of time while also changing with hyperparameters for effective finetuning.\n",
    "5. Model Evaluation & Testing - Testing models on new and unseen data and recording metrics and important observations.\n",
    "6. Model Deployment - Setting up a simple basic webpage to return feedback of sample videos placed into it with the use of API's to return people statistics and other information that can be drawn from the use case.     \n"
